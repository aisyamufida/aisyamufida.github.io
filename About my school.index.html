<h1 style="color:Tomato;">My Biodata</h1>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Hello everyone!!~ let me introduce myself! My name is Aisya Mufida Ramadhani but you can call me Aisya. I was born in Bogor on November 21st 2003. I'm a student 2nd grade in SMAKBO. I have an interest in cooking, dancing, and learning a new language . I also like to play with my cats in spare times.</p>
<p>My school name is Bogor High School of Chemical Analyst or we call it <strong><a href="http://www.smakbo.sch.id">SMAKBO</a></strong>. Basically it is one of the famous vocational schools in my city. Also I wanted to emphasize that my high school is a science focused school. You can see from the name its a High School of Chemical Analyst but it does not focus only on studying the chemistry subject itself but we also focus on its application as well as chemistry practical and experiment. It doesn't mean that we only study purely science, we also have social science, religion education, arts & culture, physical education, however a really large focus is put on science. My high school is a bit different system-wise. We studied here for 4 years and in the first three years we are required to study the whole general high school course like biology, math, english, etc and for the remaining 1 year, we participated in the internship and got a chance to work side by side with accomplished industry professionals.</p>
